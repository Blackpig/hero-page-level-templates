hero-page-level-templates
=========================

Add ability to select templates at the individual page rather than by content-type.

Note - this code alters core files and is offered as is. It was modified to suit the purposes of my project
and has not been tested beyond that scope.

You can locate altered code by searching for Blackpig in the source.

Obviously this is not upgrade proof.

To install:

1. Make a back-up copy of the /app/modules/publish folder
2. Replace the files in the above /app/modules/publish folder with their counterparts in this git respository.

Feel free to fork, improve, fix etc.

Peace
The Blackpig
